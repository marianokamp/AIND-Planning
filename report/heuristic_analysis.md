# Heuristic Analysis 

__Provide an optimal plan for Problems 1, 2, and 3.__

xxx

__Compare and contrast non-heuristic search result metrics (optimality, time
elapsed, number of node expansions) for Problems 1,2, and 3. Include
breadth-first, depth-first, and at least one other uninformed non-heuristic
search in your comparison; Your third choice of non-heuristic search may be
skipped for Problem 3 if it takes longer than 10 minutes to run, but a note in
this case should be included.__

xxx

__Compare and contrast heuristic search result metrics using A-Star with the "ignore
preconditions" and "level-sum" heuristics for Problems 1, 2, and 3.__

xxx

__What was the best heuristic used in these problems? Was it better than
non-heuristic search planning methods for all problems? Why or why not?__
